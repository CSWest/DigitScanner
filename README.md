This project is a handwritten number recognition software, using a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The network learns with the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm, using the cross-entropy as a cost function.

I was rather focused on understanding the principles of ANN in this project, so I coded the whole project myself and didn't use any libraries. You should consider using linear algebra librairies if you want greater performances.

Language: C++<br/>

Functions:
   - 'save':  saves the neural network in a file
   - 'load':  loads a neural network from a file
   - 'train': use training data to update the weights and biases
   - 'test':  gives the output and score for a given testing set
