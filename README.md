#### Project: DigitsScanner<br/>
#### Author: DEISS Olivier<br/>

This project is a handwritten number recognition software, using a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The network learns with the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm.

Warning: I was rather focused on understanding the principles of ANN in this project, so I coded the whole project myself and didn't use any libraries. This makes this project highly inneficient, and you should consider using linear algebra librairies if you want greater performances.

Language: C++<br/>
